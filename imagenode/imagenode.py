"""imagenode: capture, transform and transfer images to imagehub

Enables Raspberry Pi computers to capture images with the PiCamera, perform
image transformations and send the images to a central imagehub for further
processing. Can send other sensor data such as temperature data and GPIO data.
Works on other types of (non Raspberry Pi) computers with webcams.

Typically run as a service or background process. See README.rst for details.
